				The New Disruptors: How&nbsp;Fishbird Is Transforming&nbsp;Pharma

				And as with all Immersion projects, these partnerships couldn’t exist without dismantling the existing Us v. Them mentality within Janssen and building up a We Are Them mindset. The literature on disruptive innovation tends to frame disruption as a battle: the heroic David against the oafish Goliath. But the challenge for large organizations is to find a way to tackle two distinct and often conflicting tasks—sustaining what exists and building something new. Acknowledging that David and Goliath are fighting the same battle was important for Immersion participants to establish. Silos had to be broken to partner with talent from one P&amp;L to work on a project whose success may accrue to another&nbsp;P&amp;L.<br><br>

				This inevitably led to management conflicts over resource allocation, and the need for Thomas to emerge as a key stakeholder in the success of Immersion. Thomas was unique among early adopters of Immersion in seeing how such a dramatic shift in work roles could support the long-term priorities of Janssen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole.<br><br>

				Cultivating this We Are Them mentality by working alongside colleagues and building alliances internally and externally has been pivotal for Immersion team leader Guy Nuyts’s success. In high school, Nuyts had a fascination with politics, an interest fueled by a teacher who taught him Hegel’s premise: you can’t have a master without a slave, a yin without a yang, a you without a me. After studying sociology, he pursued his doctorate, during which time he worked in a hospital and became interested in epidemiology, eventually leading him to Janssen, where he’s worked for the last sixteen&nbsp;years.<br><br>

				As Nuyts launched MDR-TB Europe and became intimately involved in Romania’s HCV project, he saw the opportunity to discard the Us v. Them paradigm. While the opinion influencers in Romania have been those who were prescribing the drugs, Nuyts discovered early on that the HCV Immersion goal of increasing treatment to 80,000 people by 2020 was going to require a much larger group of stakeholders, including the World Health Organization and the Romanian Ministry of Health. The focus needed to shift away from short-term profits derived from selling to lining up and working with the various stakeholders in order to raise awareness, increase screening, register patients and treat&nbsp;them. <br><br>			
		
				A small but pivotal win came earlier this year. Nuyts was part of a Janssen delegation, alongside competitors AmGen and Eli Lilly, to confer with the Romanian Minister of Health on methods for tackling issues of public health. And since Janssen was focused on long-term results for Romania, rather than on short-term pricing wins, they received the full attention of the minister and an invitation to follow&nbsp;up.

				Partnering with Nuyts to cultivate this belief that We Are Them was Jami Taylor, who felt that she’d been training her entire life to advocate for a more robust and appropriate view of public health on the world stage. Growing up in Washington, D.C. as part of a political family, one of Taylor’s first memories was of holding campaign signs and attending political fundraisers before school. It was during these formative years that she learned how to mobilize people in support of&nbsp;an&nbsp;idea. <br><br>

				Being invited into Immersion has been a thrill for Taylor; she’s loved facilitating conversations with government leaders from Peru to Romania to Poland. As Nuyts shares, “The best part of Immersion is solving problems in a holistic way: there is no doubt that this is the future of&nbsp;healthcare.”<br><br>

				Implementing disruptive ideas is an exacting endeavor, in part because it involves disruption of self. Individuals must dive into the depths of the unknown even as they wonder if there will be enough breathing room within the organization as they come up for air. There have been times when people involved in Immersion, after being in the field all day, must catch up on their  day job at night. For some, this has been a real career risk. It also requires learning to communicate in new ways. Some are naturals at cold calling and enlisting help, others initially communicated awkwardly and are only now learning to speak powerfully about their&nbsp;vision.<br><br>

				And yet, as Immersion participants approach public health issues from a broader strategic and emotional perspective than a typical product launch, they are building new alliances and discovering new stakeholders both inside and outside Janssen, from government officials to entrepreneurs and NGOs. “The speed and initiative that people are taking on, and the enthusiasm about something new, has been nothing short of inspiring,” shares Underwood, now overseeing the transformed TB Peru project, which under his leadership has refocused on mHealth, a digital adherence platform that will soon be piloted in&nbsp;Uganda. <br><br>

				Nicholl echoes this Underwood’s sentiment. “I’ve gotten to see individuals excel. As Immersion captured their imagination they’ve really come to life.” Esteban agrees. “Every time I go to Poland, there are tremendously satisfying moments: engagement and enrollment with Janssen colleagues, as well as external stakeholders, governments, and private corporations.” For many, Immersion is the best part of their work. And while the people behind Immersion may change as projects continue to grow, the disruptive spirit that has been created will carry Janssen, and healthcare as a whole,&nbsp;forward.
